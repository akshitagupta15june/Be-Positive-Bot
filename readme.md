## Inspiration

Generally, the students who want to code start their coding journey through 100 days of code challenge.
They make a habit of coding or learning any new topics or concepts for at least 3-4 hours, straight for 100 days and for that they tweet their daily work on Twitter and show how much or what they have learned.
In this way, more and more people are willing to take this challenge because it takes nothing but your hard work to achieve your desired goal.

## What it does

Just tweet your daily code with bot username @Cool_OctocatBot and #100daysofcode hashtag and the bot will respond back soon in seconds by "Great Job, All the Best! #EatSleepCodeRepeat " and other various encouraging words.

## How we built it

I built it Tweepy: Twitter for Python!

my_twitter_bot.py - This is the main python file that includes all the logic.

last_seen_id.txt - This will contain the ID of the tweet that my_twitter_bot.py has seen last. If you see any errors when running the main python file, try replacing the content with the ID of one of the tweets you want to examine.

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into challenges when we have to extract and visualize the hashtags as many people write hashtags in different ways, some write in capital and some write in small so we have to look into that so that the bot should respond correctly every time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to create an awesome Twitter bot that appreciates the wonderful work done by people.

## What we learned

We learned tweepy and how to use Twitter API.

## What's next for Be-Positive-Bot

We will try to make more bots like this and spread positivity.
